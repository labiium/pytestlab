# Getting Started

How to get started with PyTestLab.

## Async-First Design

PyTestLab is designed to be asynchronous from the ground up, using modern `async/await` syntax. This allows for high-performance, non-blocking I/O operations with instruments, which is especially important for complex experiments with multiple devices.

For a detailed explanation of our design philosophy and guidance on when to use synchronous or asynchronous code, please refer to our comprehensive guide on [Async vs. Sync](./async_vs_sync.md).
