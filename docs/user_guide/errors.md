# Error Handling in PyTestLab

PyTestLab uses a set of custom exception types to handle errors that may occur during instrument communication, configuration, and operation. Understanding these exceptions is crucial for writing robust and reliable test scripts. This guide provides an overview of the common exception types and best practices for handling them.

## Common Exception Types

Here are some of the most common exception types you may encounter when using PyTestLab:

### `InstrumentParameterError`

This exception is raised when an invalid parameter is passed to an instrument method. For example, if you try to set a voltage on a power supply that is outside its valid range, an `InstrumentParameterError` will be raised.

### `InstrumentConnectionError`

This exception is raised when PyTestLab fails to connect to an instrument. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as an incorrect instrument address, a network issue, or the instrument being offline.

### `InstrumentCommunicationError`

This exception is raised when there is an error in the communication with the instrument after a connection has been established. This could be due to a timeout, a malformed command, or an unexpected response from the instrument.

### `InstrumentNotFoundError`

This exception is raised when you try to access an instrument that has not been defined in your bench configuration.

### `InstrumentConfigurationError`

This exception is raised when there is an error in the instrument's profile configuration. This can happen if the profile is missing required information or if it does not conform to the expected schema.

## Best Practices for Exception Handling

It is important to handle exceptions gracefully in your test scripts to prevent them from crashing and to ensure that your tests are reliable. Here are some best practices for exception handling in PyTestLab:

### Catching Specific Exceptions

It is always better to catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `except Exception:`. This allows you to handle different types of errors in different ways. For example, you might want to retry a connection if you get an `InstrumentConnectionError`, but you might want to fail a test if you get an `InstrumentParameterError`.

Here is an example of how to catch specific exceptions:

```python
from pytestlab.bench import Bench
from pytestlab.errors import InstrumentConnectionError, InstrumentParameterError

try:
    bench = Bench("path/to/your/bench.yaml")
    psu = bench.get_instrument("power_supply")
    psu.set_voltage(100)  # This might raise an InstrumentParameterError
except InstrumentConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Failed to connect to instrument: {e}")
except InstrumentParameterError as e:
    print(f"Invalid parameter: {e}")
```

### Using `try...finally` for Cleanup

The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This makes it a good place to put cleanup code, such as disconnecting from an instrument.

```python
from pytestlab.bench import Bench
from pytestlab.errors import InstrumentConnectionError

bench = None
try:
    bench = Bench("path/to/your/bench.yaml")
    # ... do something with the bench ...
except InstrumentConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Failed to connect to instrument: {e}")
finally:
    if bench:
        bench.disconnect_all()
```

## Debugging Common Errors

Here are some tips for debugging common errors in PyTestLab:

*   **Check your instrument address:** If you are getting an `InstrumentConnectionError`, the first thing you should do is check that the instrument address in your bench configuration is correct.
*   **Check your instrument's manual:** If you are getting an `InstrumentParameterError`, check the instrument's manual to make sure that you are using the correct parameters.
*   **Enable logging:** PyTestLab uses the `logging` module to log information about its operations. You can enable logging to get more detailed information about what is happening behind the scenes.
*   **Use the interactive console:** You can use the interactive console to connect to an instrument and send commands to it manually. This can be a useful way to debug communication issues.
