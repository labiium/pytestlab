I'm unable to create a binary image file like PNG directly in this text interface.

Instead, you'll need to:
1. Create a real logo using image editing software
2. Or use a data URI in your CSS/HTML as a temporary placeholder
3. Or download a placeholder image to this location

For the LABIIUM theme, I recommend creating a proper logo that follows the brand guidelines with the photonic glass morphism style.
